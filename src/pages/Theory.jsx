  GENERAL: `# What is a Tree?\nA Tree is a fundamental **non-linear** data structure that represents hierarchical data, like a family tree or a company's organization chart.\n\nIt consists of a collection of **nodes** connected by **edges**, with one special node designated as the **Root**.\n\n## Key Concepts:\n- **Root**: The topmost node, where the tree originates.\n- **Parent**: A node that has child nodes connected below it.\n- **Child**: A node that has a parent node above it.\n- **Leaf**: A node with **no children**. These are the endpoints of the tree.\n- **Edge**: The link or connection between a parent and a child node.`,
  BT: `# What is a Binary Tree?\nA **Binary Tree** is a specialized tree where the "binary" part is key: each node can have **at most two children**.\n\nThese children are referred to as the **left child** and the **right child**. This simple constraint is the foundation for many powerful and efficient data structures like BSTs and Heaps.\n\n## Key Properties:\n- Each node contains a **value** or key.\n- Each node has pointers to a left child and a right child, which can be *null*.\n- The path from the root to any node is **unique**.\n\n## Types of Binary Trees:\n- **Full Binary Tree**: Every node has either **0 or 2** children.\n- **Complete Binary Tree**: All levels are completely filled except possibly the last, which is filled from **left to right**.\n- **Perfect Binary Tree**: A full binary tree where all leaf nodes are at the **same level**.\n- **Skewed Binary Tree**: Each node is connected to only one child, resembling a linked list.`,
  BST: `# Binary Search Tree (BST)\nA **BST** is a special type of binary tree that keeps its data **sorted**. This provides a massive advantage for searching.\n\nFor any given node, it follows one strict rule:\n  - All values in its **left subtree** must be *less than* the node's value.\n  - All values in its **right subtree** must be *greater than* the node's value.\n\nThis property makes search, insert, and delete operations incredibly efficient, with an average time complexity of **O(log n)**. However, if the tree becomes unbalanced, this can degrade to O(n).`,
  AVL: `# AVL Tree\nAn **AVL tree** is a *self-balancing* Binary Search Tree. It's a smarter BST that refuses to become lopsided.\n\nThe heights of the two child subtrees of any node can differ by **at most one**. If they ever differ by more, the tree automatically performs **rotations** to restore its balance.\n\n## Balancing Operations:\n- **Left Rotation (LL)**\n- **Right Rotation (RR)**\n- **Left-Right Rotation (LR)**\n- **Right-Left Rotation (RL)**\n\nBy keeping itself balanced, AVL trees guarantee **O(log n)** time complexity for all major operations, even in the worst-case scenario.`,
  RB: `# Red-Black Tree\nA **Red-Black Tree** is another type of *self-balancing* BST that uses node **colors** (red or black) to ensure balance.\n\nBy enforcing a set of properties, it ensures that the longest path from the root to any leaf is no more than twice as long as the shortest path, keeping operations efficient.\n\n## Core Properties:\n1. Every node is either **red** or **black**.\n2. The root is always **black**.\n3. There are no two adjacent **red** nodes.\n4. Every path from a node to any of its descendant leaves has the **same number of black nodes**.`,
  HEAP: `# Heap\nA **Heap** is a specialized tree-based data structure that is a *nearly complete* binary tree. Its primary use is to efficiently access the minimum or maximum element.\n\nHeaps come in two main types:\n- **Max-Heap**: The value of each parent node is **greater than or equal to** the value of its children. The root holds the largest element.\n- **Min-Heap**: The value of each parent node is **less than or equal to** the value of its children. The root holds the smallest element.\n\nHeaps are the perfect data structure for implementing **Priority Queues** and are the core of the **Heapsort** algorithm.`,
  TRIES: `# Trie (Prefix Tree)\nA **Trie** is a unique tree-like data structure that is highly efficient for storing and retrieving **strings**. Instead of storing keys, each node represents a single character.\n\nThe path from the root to a node represents a **prefix**, and a special marker on a node indicates the end of a complete word.\n\n## Key Advantages:\n- Tries can insert and find strings in **O(L)** time, where L is the length of the string.\n- They are extremely effective for applications like **autocomplete**, **spell checkers**, and **IP routing**.\n\nEach node in a Trie can have multiple children, one for each possible character in the alphabet being used (e.g., 26 for English).`,

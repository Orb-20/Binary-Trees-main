At Tree Corp, the CEO has already implemented the Two-Teammate Policy, establishing a Binary Tree structure. Now, to enhance organization, a new rule is introduced: the "Sorted Teammates Policy."

This policy dictates that for any manager:

- If a new team member has a lower rank or value, they are placed on the left side.

- If a new team member has a higher rank or value, they are placed on the right side.

This rule is not just for the CEO's direct reports; every manager and team lead in Tree Corp follows the same principle for their own team members, turning the entire company into a perfectly sorted organizational chart. The advantages are immediately apparent:

- Faster searching: To find an employee, you simply navigate left for lower ranks or right for higher ranks until you find them.

- Organized growth: As new employees join, their position in the hierarchy is automatically determined.

- Clear hierarchy: The structure is clean, organized, and easy to understand.

In short:

- A Binary Tree Corp has a maximum of two team members under any manager.

! - A BST Corp follows the same rule but sorts team members by their rank or value: left is for lower, and right is for higher.`;

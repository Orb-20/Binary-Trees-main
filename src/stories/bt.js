export const binaryTreeStory = `Following the success of Tree Corp, the CEO decides to implement a new policy to streamline management: the "Two-Member Policy."

This new rule dictates that every manager can have at most two team members directly reporting to them.

The CEO (the Root) can have up to two direct reports. Each of these managers can also have a maximum of two employees under their supervision, and this structure continues down the line. The entire company now resembles a clean, organized chart where every individual manages at most two people, designated as a left and a right team member.

What makes this structure powerful?

The positions of the left and right team members are not arbitrary. Their placement becomes significant when we introduce specialized rules, which you'll encounter with Binary Search Trees. For now, the key takeaway is that a Binary Tree is a tree where each node has a maximum of two children.

In short:

- A standard Tree Corp allows any manager to have an unlimited number of team members.

! - A Binary Tree Corp enforces a strict rule: only two team members are allowed per manager, one on the left and one on the right.`;

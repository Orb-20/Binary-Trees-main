export const generalTreeStory = `Imagine a large corporation named Tree Corp.

At the very top, there is a single CEO. This CEO is the Root of the company. The CEO hires a few managers, who are the Nodes of our corporate tree. Each manager, in turn, can hire their own team members, creating more nodes.

- Every employee has only one direct supervisor (a parent), but a supervisor can manage multiple employees (children).

- Some employees do not manage anyone; they are the Leaves of the company.

There is a strict rule at Tree Corp: no employee can be their own boss, which means there are no loops in the hierarchy. The structure always flows downward from the CEO to the managers and their teams.

Why is Tree Corp so successful?

- Organized hierarchy: It's clear who reports to whom.

- Easy searching: To find any employee, you simply follow the chain of command from the CEO.

- Flexible growth: New employees can be easily added under the appropriate manager.

In the world of data structures and algorithms, a Tree is just like Tree Corpâ€™s hierarchy:

- Root: The CEO

- Nodes: Managers and Employees

- Leaves: Employees who do not manage anyone.`;
